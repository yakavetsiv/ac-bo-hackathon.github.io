## Now - Mar 27

Brainstorm, build, team up.

1. Add the events to your calendar using the ["Add to Calendar" link from the Gather Town event page](https://app.gather.town/events/aWWEyxSfRJGgvVwT3rSA) (for Outlook calendars, you will need to login to Outlook online)
2. Enter your email into [this form](https://forms.gle/1AKnQrdgCPk2Yts96) or send an email to [sterling.baird@utoronto.ca](mailto:sterling.baird@utoronto.ca) with subject line "Slack guest invite request" so that we can manually add you as a guest to the `#ac-bo-hackathon` slack channel, or if your workspace has Slack Pro, join the [Slack channel directly](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNjg2ODE3OTIwMDcwNC1iNzhiOGYxNzJiN2JkMWIxN2VkMDc4ODNlM2RjMDQ4ZTYyNTI0ZTdhZTZiMDgwMzE3ZTdjZjQ1ZmUxN2E4MjMz). These are the preferred options over starting a Slack Pro free trial, since you will lose access to the channel once the trial has expired. The free trial route (e.g., in a personal workspace) is a fallback if you need immediate access to the slack channel.
3. Brainstorm project ideas and form teams
   1. Browse [the existing project proposals](_/../projects.md)
   2. If you'd like to solicit team members or get feedback, post your project idea in the slack channel with the `#team` hashtag to make it easier to search for these posts. You may also consider using social media
   3. If you would like to join a team, use the slack channel to express your interest and describe your background, again using the `#team` hashtag
   4. Submit your [project proposal](_/../submission.md) (multiple allowed)
4. For coding-related projects, [complete the orientation modules](_/../resources.md)

<!-- 4. If you plan to join an existing project, use the GitHub Classroom link corresponding to the project topic and select the appropriate team on the GitHub Classroom interface (see [submission](_/../submission.md)). Reach out to [sterling.baird@utoronto.ca](mailto:sterling.baird@utoronto.ca) if you have trouble getting added to your team -->
